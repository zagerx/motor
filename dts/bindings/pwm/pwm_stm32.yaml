  STM32S PWM device.

  The PWM device is expected to be a children of any STM32 advanced control
  timer. Example usage:

      &timers1 {
          pwm: pwm {
              compatible = "st,stm32-pwm-custom";
              pinctrl-0 = <&tim1_ch1_pa8 &tim1_ch2_pa9 &tim1_ch3_pa10 &tim1_ocp_pa11>;
              pinctrl-names = "default";
              t_dead = <1000>;  // 死区时间配置
              ...
          };
      };

compatible: "st,stm32-pwm-custom"
